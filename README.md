# Wcode

Wcode is a script that automates vscode installation and loads it with a few new features.

# Install:
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yzeybek/Wcode/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"
```

# Uninstall:
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yzeybek/Wcode/refs/heads/main/uninstall.sh)"
```
